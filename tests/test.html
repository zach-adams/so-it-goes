          	<p>It searches the page for text, and when it finds text elements it searches it for keywords. If a keyword is found it will separate that text element by sentences and find the sentence with the keyword. Once the keyword sentence is identified it quickly fixes the format if it's off (like if it doesn't end in a period or if it has some funky whitespace), then it adds the phrase "So it goes." to the sentence. It then replaces that sentence with the new one, then replaces the text element with the new one.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>dead. So it goes.</li>
				<li>deaths. So it goes.</li>

<span class="article-prime"><p><span class="articleLocation">YENAGOA, Nigeria</span> The father of a former Nigerian militant leader has died after sustaining injuries during a government military campaign aimed at halting attacks on infrastructure in the oil-producing Delta region, his spokesman said late on Wednesday.  </p></span><span id="midArticle_0"></span><p>Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo, is a commander of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a group that spearheaded attacks on oil and gas installations in Nigeria's Delta region in the early 2000s until a government amnesty program halted the attacks by offering contracts to protect pipelines and oil production equipment.</p><span id="midArticle_1"></span><p>His 84-year-old father, Chief Thomas Ekpemupolo, died at a hospital in Warri, Delta state, as a result of injuries sustained during military incursions into his community, a spokesman for Tompolo said. </p><span id="midArticle_2"></span>

            <span class="article-divide first-article-divide"></span><p>Comment from the government was not immediately available.</p><span id="midArticle_3"></span><p>The death may inflame hostilities in the oil-rich region, which kicked off not long after an arrest warrant was issued for Tompolo in January on charges of corruption.</p><span id="midArticle_4"></span>

            <span class="article-divide second-article-divide"></span><p>The violence has shut down more than 700,000 barrels per day of oil production and exacerbated an economic crisis in a nation reeling from its first recession in two decades. Tompolo has denied any involvement in the attacks on oil and gas infrastructure, as well as the corruption charges. He remains in hiding.</p><span id="midArticle_5"></span>
